        Interrupt received. Shutting down the pipeline.
      configuration:
        setting_missing: |-
          Missing a required setting for the %{plugin} %{type} plugin:

            %{type} {
              %{plugin} {
                %{setting} => # MISSING
                ...
              }
            }
        setting_invalid: |-
          Invalid setting for %{plugin} %{type} plugin:

            %{type} {
              %{plugin} {
                # This setting must be a %{value_type}

                ...
              }
            }
        invalid_plugin_settings: |-
          Something is wrong with your configuration.
        plugin_path_missing: |-
          You specified a plugin path that does not exist: %{path}
        no_plugins_found: |-
          Could not find any plugins in "%{path}"
          I tried to find files matching the following, but found none: 
            %{plugin_glob}
        log_file_failed: |-
          Failed to open %{path} for writing: %{error}

          This is often a permissions issue, or the wrong 
          path was specified?
      flag:
        # Wrap these at 45 chars so they display nicely when clamp emits them in
        # an 80-character terminal
        config: |-
          Load the logstash config from a specific file
          or directory.  If a direcory is given, all
          files in that directory will be concatonated
          in lexicographical order and then parsed as a
          single config file. You can also specify
          wildcards (globs) and any matched files will
          be loaded in the order described above.
        config-string: |-
          Use the given string as the configuration
          data. Same syntax as the config file. If not
          input is specified, then 'stdin { type =|-
          stdin }' is the default input. If no output
          is specified, then 'stdout { debug => true
          }}' is default output.
        filterworkers: |-
          Sets the number of filter workers to run.
        watchdog-timeout: |-
          Set the filter watchdog timeout (in seconds).
          This timeout is used to detect stuck filters;
          stuck filters usually symptoms of bugs.
          When a filter takes longer than TIMEOUT
          seconds, it will cause logstash to abort.
        log: |-
          Write logstash internal logs to the given
          file. Without this flag, logstash will emit
          logs to standard output.
        verbosity: |-
          Increase verbosity of logstash internal logs.
          Specifying once will show 'informational'
          logs. Specifying twice will show 'debug'
          logs.
        version: |-
          Emit the version of logstash and its friends,
          then exit.
        pluginpath: |-
          A path of where to find plugins. This flag
          can be given multiple times to include
          multiple paths. Plugins are expected to be
          in a specific directory hierarchy:
          'PATH/logstash/TYPE/NAME.rb' where TYPE is
          'input' 'filter' or 'output' and NAME is the
          name of the plugin.
